# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to predict the number of sea lions in an aerial photograph using a convolutional neural network. This is a relaxed version of the [Kaggle competition]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-fisheries-steller-sea-lion-population-count/data) sponsored by the NOAA. This serves as the final project for the CS 431 - Artificial Intelligence class at the University of Puget Sound.
